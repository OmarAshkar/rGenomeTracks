Description: rGenomeTracks package leverages the power of pyGenomeTracks software
             with the interactivity of R.
             pyGenomeTracks is a python software that offers robust method for visualizing
             epigenetic data files like narrowPeak, Hic matrix, TADs and arcs, however though,
             here is no way currently to use it within R interactive session.
             rGenomeTracks wrapped the whole functionality of pyGenomeTracks with additional utilites
             to make to more pleasant for R users.
